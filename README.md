## Overview

### The challenge

Users must be able to:

- See the optimal design for the site according to the screen size of your device
- View hover states for all interactive elements on the page

I could say that this is my first landing page in bootstrap. I always use some custom css and some bootstrap selector, right now I'm still learning how to implement its full power in HTML and CSS.

In fact, I need to clean up the html code a bit in this layout, but I need to continue with another project, for now I'm happy with the result.

## My process
This project was not supposed to be this long. I was working this solution in laravel to practice more with blade and libraries like sass, bootstrap etc. in that environment.

When I finished the solution, I got really frustrated trying to deploy the project with the railway (sad Heroku moment), so I decide to do it statically.

PS.If anyone knows a platform where to implement a project like laravel, please let me know...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- First mobile workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For Bootstrap style containers and layouts
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - To compile CSS
- [Swiper Js](https://styled-components.com/) - For Client Carousel section
- [AOS Animation](https://styled-components.com/) - For animation of scrolling sections


### What I learned
I think the best part of this project was finding a better vision to lay out each section and how each one works on top of another.

I learned a lot about how to better structure my HTML to get an advantage in CSS and better responsive results.


### Continuous development
as i said before, i would like to do more projects in Laravel, i also want to do some applications in React or focus on a new technology... but all in due time
